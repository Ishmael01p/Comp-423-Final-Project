The final project is very open-ended and there are no specific requirements for what your final project does per se. There will be 100 overall points awarded as follows:

30 points: Having a front end that is interactive and event-driven
30 points: Having a back end that serves at least two resources with a RESTful CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) API.
10 points: Uses at least one 3rd party API
10 points: Uses session-persistent state in some way.
For example, authenticating the user and then having user-specific preferences and/or data.
10 points: A pleasing user experience (i.e., easy to use, good design, etc.).
10 points: Quality of presentation video (see below)
Each group will be expected to turn in their final projects as a repository with all of the code, stylesheets, images, and any other files developed as part of their project with a top-level README.md file that briefly describes their project and includes a link to a presentation video. Please be sure NOT to include npm modules or external libraries. Use .gitignore to exclude these kinds of things from your repository.

The presentation video should be no more than 10 minutes long and should demonstrate your final project and describe the various components of its implementation. You should think of this as if you are presenting your work to someone who may be interested in purchasing your software. To that end, you are trying to show that the web application you built is interesting, useful, and well-constructed. We will be primarily grading based on your presentation video, so be sure that it appropriately points out or otherwise demonstrates the various aspects listed above (i.e., interactive front-end, backend RESTful API, 3rd party APIs in use, session-persistent state, design elements, etc.).

The official due date for the final project is 12/3 but final projects will be accepted until 12/10 with a 1 point penalty per day.

All team members will receive the same number of points for their final project grade subject to adjustments made based on reported effort assessment. The final project attestation includes an effort self-assessment and assessment of your team members. The effort assessment will be used in the following way:

If one specific team member is assessed as deserving extra consideration from all other team members, I will consider awarding up to 3 more points to that specific team member. A number of factors will go into my consideration, including whether there is evidence that two or more team members are simply nominating each other for extra consideration.
If a team member is identified as having not met the minimum expectations of a teammate, I will investigate the situation and, if necessary, that team member will be graded separately.
